# Jayeen's Housing 
## Description  
Welcome to Jayeen's Housing client side git repository. This project is based on aprtment selling system. In order to Book an apartment customer has to be logged in. Then they can access the private routes to place booking. I have implemented password based login system. I have used reactjs with material ui framework for the frontend and nodejs for the backend and the mongo db for the database.
